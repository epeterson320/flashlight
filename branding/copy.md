Most flashlight apps feature a screen that looks like a flashlight and can
turn on and off your device's flashlight. If you think that is WAY too
complicated, Occam's Flashlight is for you. Occam's flashlight consists of an
icon that launches NO screen and can turn on and off your device's flashlight
just by tapping the launcher icon. Other features include:

* No posts to Facebook
* No animations
* No screens
* No ads
* No brightness control
* No notifications
* No Chromecast integration
* Not optimized for tablets
* Winner of zero awards

This is the simplest possible flashlight. A 2MB photo takes 15 times as much
storage as the app.
