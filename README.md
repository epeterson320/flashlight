Most flashlight apps consist of a launcher icon that, when clicked, opens a
screen that looks like a flashlight, and turns on your device's flashlight. If
you think that is WAY too complicated, Occam's Flashlight is for you. Occam's
flashlight is a non-award winning app that consists of an icon that, when
clicked, launches NO screen and turns on your device's flashlight. Touching the
launcher again turns off the flashlight. Other features include:

* No posts to Facebook
* No animations
* No screens
* No ads
* No brightness control
* No notifications
* No Chromecast integration
* Not optimized for tablets
