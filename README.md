Most flashlight apps consist of a launcher icon that, when clicked, opens a
screen that looks like a flashlight, and turns on your device's flashlight. If
you think that is WAY too complicated, Occam's Flashlight is for you. It
consists of an icon that, when clicked, launches NO screen and turns on your
device's flashlight, unless the flashlight is already on, in which case it
turns it off. Other features include:

* No chromecast integration
* Not optimized for tablets
* No posts to Facebook
* No animations
* No screens
* No brightness control
