"A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."
— Antoine de Saint-Exupéry


Most flashlight apps feature a screen that looks like a flashlight and can turn your device's flashlight on and off. If you think that is WAY too complicated, Occam's Flashlight is for you. Occam's Flashlight consists of an icon that launches NO screen. Control your device's flashlight just by tapping the launcher icon. Other features include:

No posts to Facebook
No animations
No screens
No ads
No brightness control
No notifications
No Chromecast integration
Not optimized for tablets
Winner of zero awards

This is the simplest possible flashlight. An average photo takes 20 times as much storage as the app.

The launcher icon is a derivative of "Light Bulb" by Sarah Tan.
